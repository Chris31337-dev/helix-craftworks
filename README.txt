— Precision is in our DNA —

This repository powers the digital presence of Helix Craftworks, a veteran-owned custom woodworking and residential construction company founded on craftsmanship, clarity, and recursion.

Inside this repo you’ll find:
- Modified HTML5 UP template (site scaffold)
- VS Code + GitHub versioning
- Ecwid integration for eCommerce
- Printful sync for apparel fulfillment
- Loom & Lathe sub-brand (Apparel + Artisan Goods)
- Brand assets, custom icons, and identity metadata (including Lyra protocols)

The site is updated and deployed manually via Git.
All changes are intentional.
All commits are ritual.

This is more than a website.
It’s a living record of a brand becoming.
